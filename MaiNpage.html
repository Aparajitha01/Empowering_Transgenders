            <h1>Quotes that inspire you</h1>
            <p><b> “All women have a complicated relationship to beauty, but as a transgender woman it’s a bit more complicated.<br> There’s a lot of pressure to appear feminine. When I was younger, I was most insecure about my size, my angular features,<br> my feet, my hands. At the end of the day, it’s about being comfortable in your own skin, and being able to walk down <br>the street and not have people question your gender- and for me being perceived as a woman.”
     <br>   </b>_ Andrej Pejic<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>

                     “I think trans women, and trans people in general, show everyone that you can define what it <br>
                    means to be a man or woman on your own terms. A lot of what feminism is about is moving outside <br>
                    of roles and moving outside of expectations of who and what you’re supposed to be to live a more <br>
                    authentic life.”<br></b> _Laverne Cox <br><b>
                    “All of us are put in boxes by our family, by our religion, by our society, our moment 
                    in history, <br>even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free<br></b>_Geena Rocero <br>
                <b> “Being transgender, like being gay, tall, short, white, black, male, or female, is another part of the human<br> 
condition that makes each individual unique and something over which we have no control. We are who we are in <br>
the deepest recesses of our minds, hearts, and identities.”<br></b> _Linda Thompson <br><b>“We are  in a place now where more and more trans people want to come forward and say,<br> ‘This is who I am’.”<br> </b>_Laverne Cox<br>

        <h1>Dream Ending in a Host of Angels Zipping Me into My Grandmother’s Dress</h1><br>
        <b><p>Once & could-be-future girl, believe we’re not like you. Sure,<br> the pickup was tucked in dusk, shed all carefree w/ its sunburn<br> shimmer. Still nothing new to say about the creek, how reeds<br> get moony, or when we saw pelicans hold hands
            & gossip.<br> But y’all must wanna get this close to soft, so here goes: spool<br> heels, silver sleeves w/ pink accents, kind to stifle the trailer<br> static, same color Dot says Granny passed in. Past since good<br> & we did keep her pearls
            for you, kissed the hems holy, darned<br> the moth marks back to true. Goes: none of it imitation. Goes:<br> we are her barefoot bloodline, butter in the salt pan. Trust<br> you’re not from this sweat but still a goodness. You once most<br>            only boy in the yard, laugh into your born polish. Step-joy,<br> uncousin: home is a name you bless in silk & cinch. Believe<br> we’re all alive here. Come hum this lace blood-warm. Glisten.<br>
